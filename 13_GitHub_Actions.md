# GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD solution that is focused purely on GitHub.

### Advantages of GitHub Actions over Jenkins
1. **Hosting:** Jenkins is self-hosted, meaning it requires its own server to run, while GitHub Actions is hosted by GitHub and runs directly in your GitHub repository.

2. **User interface:** Jenkins has a complex and sophisticated user interface, while GitHub Actions has a more streamlined and user-friendly interface that is better suited for simple to moderate automation tasks.

3. **Cost:** Jenkins can be expensive to run and maintain, especially for organizations with large and complex automation needs. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is free for open-source projects and has a tiered pricing model for private repositories, making it more accessible to smaller organizations and individual developers.

### Advantages of Jenkins over GitHub Actions
1. **Integration:** Jenkins can integrate with a wide range of tools and services, but GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with the GitHub platform, making it easier to automate tasks related to your GitHub workflow.

*In conclusion, Jenkins is better suited for complex and large-scale automation tasks, while GitHub Actions is a more cost-effective and user-friendly solution for simple to moderate automation needs.*
